# Detection-and-Mitigation-of-NDP-attack-for-AMI-devices-in-Smart-Grid-
A smart meter is a digital device that provides advanced functionalities of remote meter reading for collecting smart meter data. This includes sending and executing control commands such as remote connect or disconnect. A smart grid electric power system delivers electricity from producers to consumers using two-way Smart Meter technology that can remotely control consumer electricity. This can help utilities to conserve energy, reduce costs, increase reliability and transparency, and make processes more efficient. However, the increasing use of IT based electric power systems increases cyber security vulnerabilities, and this increases the importance of Cyber Security. In the project 5 unique attacks scenarios are described in ICMPv6 - NDP protocol and their mitigation too.
